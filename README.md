This Github repo contains the data, scripts and notes for the course project assignment on data transformation and tidying.

The CodeBook.md file contains notes and descriptions of the data, where they are from and what was done to transform them into a smaller, flat, tidy dataset for further analysis.

One R script was written to load the original data, do the transformations and aggregation, relabel column  names with descriptive values and write the tidy data sets to the drive.

Thanks
